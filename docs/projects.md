# Projects, places and roots

A render runs one story in an emulated `DataModel`. Beside the story, rur mounts a project: your game's
or plugin's source, so the story's `require`s reach real modules.

## Roots

A root is a directory laid out by service: `<root>/ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Button.luau` becomes
`game.ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Button`, `<root>/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/...` becomes
`game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts...`. Folders become Folders (`init.luau` and `init.meta.json`
work as in Rojo), `.luau` files become ModuleScripts (`.server.luau` / `.client.luau` Scripts and
LocalScripts), `.json` files JSON modules and `.rbxm` / `.rbxmx` files the instances they hold.

`--roots "<dir>;<dir>"` names the roots of a run directly. Without it they come from the project's place.

## Projects and places

The project is `--project <dir>`, else the `RUR_PROJECT` environment variable, else
[`examples/project`](../examples/project) in this checkout. A project's places are named sets of roots,
declared in the project's `rur.json`:

```json
{
	"places": [
		{ "name": "client", "roots": ["shared", "client"] },
		{ "name": "server", "roots": ["shared", "server"] }
	]
}
```

- Roots are relative to the project directory. Keep them direct children of it: the engine reads its
  per-root settings from the same `rur.json`, keyed by the root folder's name (below).
- The first place is the default. Without `places` (or without a `rur.json`) a project has one place,
  `default`, whose only root is the project directory.
- A story runs in `--place <name>` when given, else in the first place whose roots contain the story,
  else in the default place. A story outside every root is mounted on its own, as a ModuleScript under
  `ReplicatedStorage.RURFixtures`; its requires must then reach the project through services
  (`game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Shared.Button`), not `script.Parent`.
- `rur stories [--place <name>|all]` lists a project's stories; a story under a root two places share is
  listed once, with the first of them.

The desktop storybook (`rur native`) lists the stories of every place of its `--project`, and the render
service watches the same roots for changes.

[cli/places.mjs](../cli/places.mjs) and [native/src/places.rs](../native/src/places.rs) implement these rules.

## Other `rur.json` keys

The engine reads these per root, as `{ "<key>": { "<root folder name>": value } }`:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `placeIds` | `game.PlaceId` for stories mounted from that root (`--place-id` overrides it) |
| `streamingTargetRadius` | makes the place streaming-enabled with that radius |
| `clientGui` | the dot-separated path of a ModuleScript whose `Mount()` builds the client's own PlayerGui, run once when an edit-mode story first reaches the PlayerGui |

And this one for the whole project:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `compareProbes` | `{ "<name>": { "luau": "<expression>", "fresh": <value> } }`: values `rur compare` reads in Studio before mounting, to report state Studio kept from an earlier compare |

## Rojo projects and explicit mounts

`--rojo <file.project.json>` (or a `--project` ending in `.project.json`) mounts what the Rojo project
describes instead (`cli/rojo.mjs`): a `DataModel` tree mounts each `$path` at its instance path
(directories as Rojo does, `$className` nodes without a `$path` as instances of that class,
`{ "optional": ... }` paths skipped when missing); any other tree mounts at
`ReplicatedStorage/<project name>` (`--rojo-at Service/Name` moves it). `--mount Service/Name=<dir|file>`
(repeatable) adds a mount of its own. With a Rojo project or mounts and no `--roots`, no project roots are
mounted. A mounted directory that holds a `default.project.json` mounts as that project, named by its
`name`, as Rojo reads it: roblox-ts packages (`node_modules/@rbxts/react`, `@rbxts-js/React`) resolve as
they do in Studio.

```powershell
node cli/rur.mjs render --rojo ../my-plugin/default.project.json --story ../my-plugin/stories/App.story.luau --plugin
```

## Studio snapshots

Stories sometimes reach instances that exist only in a Studio place (GUI templates kept in
`ServerStorage`, say). Offline they are placeholders with default properties. `node
tools/sweep/studio-assets.mjs` exports such instances from the open Studio into `<Service>.rbxm` files,
and `--snapshot-dir <dir>` loads them into a run. Nothing loads a snapshot implicitly.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RUR_PROJECT` | the default project |
| `RUR_STATE_DIR` | caches, builds and logs (default `.cache` in this checkout) |
| `RUR_OUT_DIR` | the default output root (default `out`) |
| `RUR_ROBLOX_CONTENT` | the Studio `content` folder fonts and `rbxasset://` textures come from (default: the installed Studio) |
| `RUR_BUNDLE_MANIFEST` | the manifest module, relative to the project, whose text keys the model bundle catalog cache |
