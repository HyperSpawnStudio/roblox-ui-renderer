# Comparing with Roblox Studio

`rur compare` mounts the same UI in a running Studio (a temporary GUI under CoreGui, removed afterwards),
captures Studio's viewport losslessly, renders it offline at the same scale and writes the difference. It
needs Windows, a running Roblox Studio and a Studio MCP bridge.

```powershell
$env:RUR_STUDIO_MCP_PORT = "<port>"
node cli/rur.mjs compare --story <file> --viewport 1200x900 --time 1
node cli/rur.mjs compare --fixture fixtures/corners.luau --viewport 800x480 --time 0.2 --background 20,20,26
```

Output in `out/compare/<name>/`: `studio.png`, `rur/` (a normal render), `diff.png`, `side-by-side.png` and
`report.json`: pixel agreement (`pixels.exactPercent`: the share of pixels whose largest channel difference
is at most 2 of 255), `layout` (every GuiObject's rect matched by path) and `propMismatches` (visual
properties that differ).

## The Studio MCP bridge

rur talks to Studio through an MCP server on a local TCP port: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, an
`initialize` handshake, then `tools/call` with two tools:

| Tool | Arguments | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `list_roblox_studios` | none | text content holding `{ "studios": [{ "id", "name" }] }`, the open Studio windows |
| `execute_luau` | `studio_id`, `datamodel_type` (`"Edit"`), `code` | text content holding what the chunk returned |

Any bridge that serves these over TCP works; the maintainers run their own. On macOS,
`node tools/studio-mcp-bridge.mjs --port 44755` is one: it serves Studio's own MCP server (StudioMCP, which
Studio runs while Assistant > Manage MCP Servers > "Enable Studio as MCP server" is on) on 127.0.0.1, so
`tools/studio-mcp.cjs` probes and roblox-object-renderer's read-only exports work there. `rur compare` still
needs Windows: its viewport capture and window resizing are `tools/wincap/` (PowerShell). Settings:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RUR_STUDIO_MCP_PORT` | the bridge's port on 127.0.0.1 (required) |
| `RUR_STUDIO` | the Studio to use: its id or part of its window title (default: the only one open; `--studio` overrides) |
| `RUR_STUDIO_LOCK` | the lock file every Studio user takes (default `<temp>/rur/studio.lock`) |
| `RUR_FOCUS=1` | bring Studio to the front for captures (it renders the same unfocused) |

`node tools/studio-mcp.cjs list` lists the open Studios through the bridge; `node tools/studio-mcp.cjs luau
<file.luau>` runs a probe in one.

## What a compare does

- Everything it mounts lives under `CoreGui` and is removed afterwards; nothing is saved and no script is
  edited.
- Studio's frame clock and the order it iterates siblings are recorded and replayed offline, so animation
  and table iteration order don't show up as rendering differences (`--no-clock`, `--ideal`).
- Studio's viewport is nudged to whole logical pixels (a fractional viewport blurs captures), using
  `tools/wincap/` (PowerShell and PrintWindow).
- Captures are reused while everything they depend on is unchanged (`studio-capture.json` beside
  `studio.png`: the mount, the Studio instance and DPI, and a hash of every source the story loaded).
  `--recapture` always captures; `--reuse-only` never touches Studio.
- Only one capture can use Studio at a time: wrap other tools that mount GUI in Studio with
  `node tools/studio-lock.mjs <command...>`.

## Parity work

To measure a rule: write a fixture that shows it ([stories.md](stories.md#writing-a-fixture)), compare it,
look at `diff.png` and `node tools/analysis/compare_crop.mjs`, change the renderer or layout, and compare
again (the capture is reused). `tools/sweep/attribute.mjs <compare dir>` attributes differing pixels to
causes (text, strokes, images, shadows, ...). Re-record the goldens only after Studio shows the change is
right.
